      “What is Voidway?” you may ask. Well, Voidway is a multimedia (hopefully) project I have been working on for 12 years, since 2013. It is a story that I have been wanting to write for a long time, and now that I have some sense of how HTML works, I can finally do what I have always wanted to do: make stories.

      So how did I create this website? Short answer: Google and ChatGPT. Googling how to make the website and how to host it and chatgpt teaching me how to use html and what everything does. Trying to use ai as a tool more than just the answer. I have a basic understanding of java and tried to code the website in java but it was just more confusing and I think html works better.

      Who am I? To be honest, just a dude. A guy who had a crazy ambition as a kid to write stories for some reason. I put a lot of thought into this story trying to write the main characters and worlds their from as best I could. I had a lot of inspiration from other people and a whole lot of different media (books, games, movies, shows, anime, etc.). I made cool characters I drew them (mostly Astral) and now I want to actually publish things.

      I said before the Voidway project is a multimedia thing, what do I mean by that? Well I want to not only write but make games, short films, and maybe even a full on show that all integrate into the full story. Building upon the world and what stuff can happen. I want to start on the written main story with the main cast but I do want to branch out into other mini stories and if I finish this main story make that into a show.

      Thank you for reading my crazy rant on this but I would highly suggest looking at the credits to see everyone who helped me build this project into what it is today. Whether an old friend or new you may find yourself in there somewhere.

      Summary: Meet Squad 798, a ragtag team of individuals who protect the different universes, or at least one of the teams. Each coming from a different universe themselves they must work together to secure voidways, a ball of condensed void that once exploded will consume the whole universe. Embark on a journey to see the team grow and learn with each other the truth that they will uncover.
