      Credits:
    </p>

    <p>
      Family: I want to thank my family for everything they have done for me. I wouldn’t be where I am today without them. Thank you if you read this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Blaid and Erik: the two brothers who helped me become the artist I am today. Would never have pursued or gotten better at art because of them. They were one of the first people to hear about this story and the project and have helped me heavily with it. Thanks guys.
    </p>

    <p>
      Ruby: She is the first person to read the story (prologue and first chapter), but thanks for helping me with this project and being the test reader.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lavender and Hollow: Now I know these names MAY sound familiar, but they are real people who helped me create the characters. As you can see, I’m bad with creating names. But these two people are the reason I wanted to persue drawing and creating art. They are both incredible artists and can do what I cant (draw in vr), if you ever see this thanks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hope and Kobold: The two people who helped me create Astral. Hope pretty much helped me make her personality and world. Kobold helped me create the final design, especially the hair, which Kobold had originally drawn, and I went with it. Kobold also gave me a character she doesn’t use that will be in a later arc. Thank you for helping me practically create the mascot of this story, since everyone loves her.
    </p>

    <p>
      These next three people inspired the characters that I made. I want to thank all of them for the fun times we had and for listening to the story and all the new things I was making for this project. Thank you for everything.
    </p>
