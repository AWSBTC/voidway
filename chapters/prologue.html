      The pain in my body is unbearable. How long have I been in here really. The end is so close I can see it. A white light shines ahead just 400 meters away. The fog makes it just barely visible but its there.
    </p>

    <p>
     “Seeker come in, are you there?” a static female voice comes from my belt. I slowly pick up the radio. My hands are shaking, the pain is unbearable but I manage to press the button.
    </p>

    <p>
     “Im here, I can see the exit. I have the data, but I don’t know if I can make it.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “We need that data Seeker, its crucial to the Society,” I hear a beep coming through the radio’s other end, “Seeker watch out there are hostiles in the area. They are about to surround the exit. You have roughly ten minutes to get here before we have to close the exit.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I slowly get up from the cold, hard ground, “Fine, ill make it in time.” I wince at every step I make. It feels like im walking on needles. Ive been here for days… weeks… months I don’t know. This place has tortured me to no end. But its all for the Society, this data is crucial to saving so many people. I just need to walk a couple more meters to finally be free.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hear groans coming from behind me, “Crap,” I go for my belt and grab my sidearm, I power it on and continue walking slowly to the exit. The fog feels like its getting thicker, maybe my mind is playing tricks on me. I feel something come up behind me and turn around a shoot whatevers there. The recoil sends a shock through my arm and I scream in pain, a black substance sprays on my body. Only just a couple meters away.
    </p>

    <p>
      The groans keep getting louder and louder, closer and closer those… things come for me. Suddenly another sound comes. Whispers. A chill goes through my spine, I start to walk faster to make sure what’s behind me not get any closer. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The light shines brighter and brighter I take a few more shots behind me each one becoming more and more painful until I have to drop my gun from fatigue. 
    </p>

    <p>
      “Damn it, Im almost there. Come on, just a few more steps.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Seeker, is that you,” the voice is coming from the exit, “quick hand us the data.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I reach for my belt again and take out my datatracker and reach towards the exit. A hand grabs my hand with the datatracker, I feel a yank but not from my hand but my device.
    </p>

    <p>
      “You have been a great service to us Seeker, but the knowledge you have is too much. Thank you for your service,” the person pushes me back out into the darkness, and the exit closes.
    </p>

    <p>
      “No, no NO. PLEASE LET ME IN. PLEASE.”
    </p>

    <p>
      I hear the whispers closing in around me. Darkness engulfs me. I cant even see anything. Not even the thing that ends me.
    </p>
