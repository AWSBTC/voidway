    <p>Bzzt bzzt</p>
    <p>“Mmmmmhg,” I try to drown the noise by putting my pillow on top of my head, but it’s no use I can still here the buzzing. I open my eyes and take the pillow off my face and say in a raspy voice, “answer call.”</p>
    <p>“HEY HEY HEY, how is my new officer in training, are you ready for your first day?"</p>
    <p>I look up to my side. A image of a gruff looking bald man stares back at me. He seems really chipper this morning… but when is he never like that. “I wanted to sleep in since I don’t have to go in for-,” I look down at my clock, “another 5 hours. But you decided to call me.”</p>
    <p>“I say waking up early gets the blood flowing, makes me wanna get up and do my missions. You know me and the guys will really miss ya, I mean you have been with this squad for years. And now you’re commanding your own, I’m proud of you son, “the man looks at me with sympathetic eyes.</p>
    <p>I look back at him with a gloomy face, “Stop trying to make me cry so early in the morning Chief, also I can see you guys whenever I mean it’s not like I’m leaving the USS.” I get out of my bed and look around my room, it’s small with the bare necessities for living. A bed, a small, cluttered desk of mutilated electronic parts, a bathroom, a kitchen, and any other thing a humanoid need to live on. “It’s gonna be great to get a bigger living space yknow.”</p>
    <p>“Are you still working on that project you got,” he looks towards the desk, “I can see the graveyard you made of your room.”</p>
    <p>I shrug, “I mean I had to get parts somewhere, “around the room are holes in the wall with wires hanging out and parts missing from anything with technology, “I mean there gonna fix the room anyway so might as well take what I needed. Anyway, I gotta get going I’ll see you later boss.”</p>
    <p>“Good luck with the rookies, this one sure is a weird batch.”</p>
    <p>I look at him smugly, “Don’t worry I got it, what can go wrong.”</p>
    <hr class="time-skip">
    <p>I am standing in front of six people ready to introduce their new-fangled life. The crowd doesn’t seem interested or look terrified because of their situation. I sigh, well nothing looks out of the ordinary. The files the doctors gave me only showed that they came in at the exact same time to the millisecond, which- to be honest is a little weird but not out of the ordinary. I mean the Hall brings in thousands of humanoids a day its not something that is impossible. I look around the room again, all of them are human (supposedly) with three girls and three boys, pretty small for a squad but should get the job done for smaller missions.</p>
    <p>“Ok time to do this,” I say under my breath, “Hello everyone, my name is Owyn and welcome to the USS.”</p>
    <p>Everyone’s head looks up at me, “now I know what you may be wondering, what is this place? Who am I? What did you sign up for… ok you didn’t really sign up but where voluntold. But anyway, welcome to the Hall.  A multi-dimensional doorway between different universes.” I turn on a projector and a image of a long hallway appears behind me. “The hall is, well, a big hallway with doors leading to different universes. Right now, we are in the center which is the USS access point. The USS stands for Universal Savior Society, as you can tell from the name we go into different doors and help humanoids, notice how I said humanoids because not everyone is human. Anyway, I won’t go into details now on what we do because it is pretty scary and we can save that for your training. But first things first does anyone have magic or special powers, I need to know right now so I can right it down in your files.”</p>
    <p>A boy with light brown hair raises his hand, his sleeve of his cloak falls as his hand raises, “I- I can use magic, like spells and stuff.”</p>
    <p>“What’s your name kid?”</p>
    <p>“Carse.” he says. I jot down his ability on the file with his name.</p>
    <p>I look up and scan around the room, “Is there anyone else? I need to know right now for your training. Trust me you guys ain’t the only one with powers and other crap.”</p>
    <p>A girl in the far back meekly raises her hand, she has dark brown hair in a bun and is wearing a feather cape. “I can see ghosts,” she says quietly, “also my name is Lavender.” Her voice becomes quieter the more she talked, I could barely understand her but was able to make out what she said, I write down SpiritFinder on her file.</p>
    <p>“Is that it?” No one else raises their hand, “ok now time for the introduction, as I said before my name is Owyn and I have been living here for many many years. I can’t really remember what my old home was, that’s how long I’ve been here.” I point to Carse, “you go next kid.”</p>
    <p>Carse stands up his cloak falling down to the floor, “Hi my name is Carse,” he waves slightly to everyone as he looks around the room. “I come from a world of magic and… yeah that’s it.” As quick as his introduction was, he sits back right back down. I sigh a little. </p>
    <p>“Ok now it’s time for you Lavender and maybe get people to know you a little better this time. “ I glare at Carse as he ducks his head onto the table.</p>
    <p>She gets up slowly, her lips are quivering as if she were about to cry, “He- hello, my name is Lavender. Th- this is the first time I have ever met anyone before.”</p>
    <p>A girl with long straight brown hair with blonde streaks asks, “Wait, anyone? But how is that possible, what about your family or like… neighbors?”</p>
    <p>“Well, my parents died when I was young, and I had a brother, but he killed himself.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, I’m so sorry I didn’t mean to sound rude. I just- I’m really confused.”</p>
    <p>I speak up a little from this awkward conversation, “Some universes really only have a couple of few people. And Lavender’s universe was a dead one that only had her as the only living humanoid. I mean there were animals but nothing with human language to put it simply.”</p>
    <p>“Also, I can see my parents and brother, or could before…” she holds back tears in her eyes, “anyway I wasn’t entirely alone I still could see and talk to my family.” </p>
    <p>“Oh, that’s good,” the girl grins widely, “my name is Hollow by the way.” She extends her hand to Lavender and both girls shake hands. Lavender slowly cracks a small smile and sits back down.</p>
    <p>Maybe this job won’t be so hard after all.</p>
