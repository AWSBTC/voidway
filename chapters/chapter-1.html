    <p>Bzzt bzzt</p>
    <p>“Mmmmmhg,” I try to drown the noise by putting my pillow on top of my head, but it’s no use I can still here the buzzing. I open my eyes and take the pillow off my face and say in a raspy voice, “answer call.”</p>
    <p>“HEY HEY HEY, how is my new officer in training, are you ready for your first day?"</p>
    <p>I look up to my side. A image of a gruff looking bald man stares back at me. He seems really chipper this morning… but when is he never like that. “I wanted to sleep in since I don’t have to go in for-,” I look down at my clock, “another 5 hours. But you decided to call me.”</p>
    <p>“I say waking up early gets the blood flowing, makes me wanna get up and do my missions. You know me and the guys will really miss ya, I mean you have been with this squad for years. And now you’re commanding your own, I’m proud of you son, “the man looks at me with sympathetic eyes.</p>
    <p>I look back at him with a gloomy face, “Stop trying to make me cry so early in the morning Chief, also I can see you guys whenever I mean it’s not like I’m leaving the USS.” I get out of my bed and look around my room, it’s small with the bare necessities for living. A bed, a small, cluttered desk of mutilated electronic parts, a bathroom, a kitchen, and any other thing a humanoid need to live on. “It’s gonna be great to get a bigger living space yknow.”</p>
    <p>“Are you still working on that project you got,” he looks towards the desk, “I can see the graveyard you made of your room.”</p>
    <p>I shrug, “I mean I had to get parts somewhere, “around the room are holes in the wall with wires hanging out and parts missing from anything with technology, “I mean there gonna fix the room anyway so might as well take what I needed. Anyway, I gotta get going I’ll see you later boss.”</p>
    <p>“Good luck with the rookies, this one sure is a weird batch.”</p>
    <p>I look at him smugly, “Don’t worry I got it, what can go wrong.”</p>
